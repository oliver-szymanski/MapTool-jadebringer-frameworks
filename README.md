# MapTool-jadebringer-frameworks

## Ideas
- minimize frame
- findToken with returning tokenId, name, map, ...
- doWithToken, changing to the zone and back again

Features:
- add call macros via Java dynamically
- add functions via Java dynamically
- have a "/call functionName(parameters)" chat macro to call any function
- security build in, checks for trusted and that no not allowed code is executed
- additional feature: load extensions as java jars via file system or any URL
- show button frames, even in fullscreen
- manipulate token on other maps
- load/save content (like csv, xml, json, ... any from token macros/properties/tables)
- function to quickly call macros locally or on another client/player
